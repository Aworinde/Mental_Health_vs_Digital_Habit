# Digital Habits vs. Mental Health

This project analyzes the relationship between digital habits—such as screen time, social media usage (with a focus on TikTok), and the number of platforms used—and key mental health indicators like sleep hours, stress level, and mood score.

## Project Structure

- `Digital_habits_vs_Mental_health.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing data analysis, visualizations, and conclusions.
- `digital_habits_vs_mental_health.csv`: Dataset used for analysis.
- `Digital Habit vs. Mental Health.pptx`: Presentation summarizing findings.

## Features

- Data cleaning and exploration using pandas and numpy
- Visualization of distributions and relationships using matplotlib and seaborn
- Correlation analysis between screen time, TikTok usage, sleep, stress, and mood
- Boxplots and scatterplots to illustrate key findings
- Summary statistics and interpretation

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook

### Required Python Packages

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn

You can install the required packages using:

```python
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

### Running the Analysis

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `Digital_habits_vs_Mental_health.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Run the notebook cells in order to reproduce the analysis and visualizations.

## Key Insights

- Higher screen time is associated with higher stress and lower mood.
- TikTok usage forms a significant portion of total screen time.
- Sleep hours are not directly affected by screen time, but stress (which is correlated with screen time) has a strong negative correlation with sleep.
- Managing screen time may help improve stress and sleep quality.
